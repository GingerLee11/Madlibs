Last night I went to the most ADJECTIVE Halloween
party! The invitation was delivered by ANIMAL
and told me to go to the deep dark LOCATION
and PRESENT-TENSE-VERB all the way to the very top of the
spooky NOUN. I PAST-TENSE-VERB the doorbell
ADVERB. EXCLAMATION! My friend NAME answered
the door dressed up as CELEBRITY and said
"SILLY WORD!" There were NUMBER different
costumes, including ADJECTIVE ghouls and a mummified
NOUN. The music was loud and ADJECTIVE, so
I PAST-TENSE-VERB until my BODY PART hurt. There were
also delicious treats to PRESENT-TENSE-VERB, like candy corn and a
chocolate-covered NOUN, but my favourite part of
the party was the pumpkin -ING-VERB and bobbing for
PLURAL NOUN. I can't wait until next Halloween;
it will be even more ADJECTIVE!
