Last night I dreamed of FOOD that was as big as a NOUN.
When I tried to take a bite, it PAST-TENSE-VERB on my NOUN.
The best FOOD that I've ever had was at LOCATION.
It tasted ADJECTIVE. 
But don't ever buy FOOD at LOCATION, it tastes ADJECTIVE.
NAME likes it best with NOUN.
Be sure to give the leftovers to your ANIMAL.
